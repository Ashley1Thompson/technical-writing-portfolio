# technical-writing-portfolio
A portfolio of my work as a technical writer.

I have more than 10 years of experience producing technical documentation in multiple contexts. I have produced video and text tutorials in the digital accessibility spacewritten STEM curricula, produced archaeological and paleontological technical reports, and maintained several knowledge bases in software, medical, and scientific fields. Below are some examples of my work. 

As a Support Engineer at DubBot I created documentation for every level of expertise, as well as internal documentation and style guides.

[An article about the WCAG 2.2 Update](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/9071761-wcag-2-2-update). In this sample I am writing for a broad audience including intermediate all the way up to Subject Mater Expert. 

[Course on Digital Accessibility](https://dubbot.thinkific.com/courses/dipping-into-accessibility). This sample is a full course I created in Thinkific that is targeted towards beginners in the digital accessibility space. Enrolled users will watch videos about a topic and then must pass a quiz with related questions to test their knowledge. User progress is tracked and certificates are issued. I created the videos using Murf.ai for voice-overs and transcripts, Canva for visual design and editing, and YouTube for hosting and closed captioning.

[An Instructional article on how to use the DubBot GA4 Connector](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/8324534-connecting-google-analytics-4). In this sample I have written instructions on connecting a users DubBot account to their Google Analytics property. Screenshots with image descriptions were used as additional guideance, following style guidelines like size and color of highlight arrows and border color and weight.
