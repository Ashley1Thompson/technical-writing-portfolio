# technical-writing-portfolio

I have more than 10 years of experience producing technical documentation in multiple contexts. I have produced video and text tutorials in the digital accessibility spacewritten STEM curricula, produced archaeological and paleontological technical reports, and maintained several knowledge bases in software, medical, and scientific fields. Below are some examples of my work.

As a Support Engineer at DubBot I created documentation for every level of expertise, as well as internal documentation and style guides.

[An article about the WCAG 2.2 Update](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/9071761-wcag-2-2-update). In this sample I am writing for a broad audience including intermediate all the way up to Subject Matter Expert. 

[Course on Digital Accessibility](https://dubbot.thinkific.com/courses/dipping-into-accessibility). This sample is a full course I created in Thinkific that is targeted towards beginners in the digital accessibility space. Enrolled users will watch videos about a topic and then must pass a quiz with related questions to test their knowledge. User progress is tracked and certificates are issued. I created the videos using Murf.ai for voice-overs and transcripts, Canva for visual design and editing, and YouTube for hosting and closed captioning.

[An Instructional article on how to use the DubBot GA4 Connector](https://help.dubbot.com/en/articles/8324534-connecting-google-analytics-4). In this sample I have written instructions on connecting a users DubBot account to their Google Analytics property. Screenshots with image descriptions were used as additional guideance, following style guidelines like size and color of highlight arrows and border color and weight.

During my time as a Lifestyle 360 director at a Long Term Care facility, a great deal of my time was spent writing reports, training materials, and activity content. Some of my writing included instructional pamphlets for residents and employees, infographic posters, and training manuals for day-to-day and specilialized tasks. I often used Canva, Adobe, and Google Workspace to accomplish these tasks.

During the COVID-19 pandemic I was asked to lead a team that would be tasked with disseminating critical protocol guidelines and warnings from the CDC to other 360 directors across the nation. The pandemic was a very volatile time and the guidelines were changing rapidly. I would receive information via emailed reports and live video conferences with the CDC twice daily and create a summary, instructional document for new protocols, several curricula for suggested engagement activities, and infographics to share with staff. These were sent out across the entire 360 team nationwide twice a week.

As a contractor in the fields of archaeology and paleontology I authored many technical reports. These reports would include detailed field notes, artifact decriptions, identification, and analysis, maps, interpretations of various types of data, site analysis, and illustrations. I used various technologies inlcuding Adobe, ArcGIS, Canva, and old-fashioned pencil and paper.

At Imagine That! and Future Tech I was responsible for creating new STEAM curricula for ages 4-14, as well as teacher guides. I also wrote training manuals for our large staff of teachers with very diverse professional backgrounds. Balancing the encouragement of creative expression in the classroom while maintaining a consistent educational experience was a fun challenge!

(Machines, Mummies, and More!)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rQCRm4AkTVWbShVfGcLYcTH-ZOQsav2H/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs]. This curriculum inlcudes a teaching guide. The delivery of the course materials at Imagine That! was narrative, so there are many references back to the overarching storyline. All concepts are described fully to allow teachers to explain the concept to students without needing to do additional research. Photo examples and instructional diagrams are inlcuded.
